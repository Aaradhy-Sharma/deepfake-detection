Sure, here's an elaborate README in Markdown format covering both methods (the deep learning model and the k-means clustering approach), along with the relevant research papers.

# Deepfake Detection

This repository contains two different approaches for detecting deepfake images: a deep learning model and a k-means clustering-based method. Both approaches leverage pre-trained models and feature extraction techniques to distinguish between real and fake images.

## Deep Learning Model

The deep learning model for deepfake detection is implemented in the `deepfake_detector.py` file. This approach follows the ideas presented in the following research papers:

1. **"Multi-attentional Deepfake Detection" by Hanqing Zhao, Xiaolei Zhu, Duc Liao, Iuri Petrov, Lyudmila Shagaeva, and Kevin Park.**
   - This paper proposes a multi-attentional framework for deepfake detection, combining features from various attention modules and leveraging the power of attention mechanisms to capture relevant spatial and temporal information.

2. **"DeepFake Detection by Analyzing Convolutional Traces" by Luca Guarnera, Oliver Giudice, and Sebastiano Battiato.**
   - This work focuses on analyzing the convolutional traces (activations) of pre-trained models to detect artifacts and inconsistencies introduced by deepfake generation methods, enabling effective detection without the need for manual feature engineering.

### Implementation Details

The `deepfake_detector.py` file contains the following key components:

- **VGG16 Pre-trained Model**: The VGG16 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, is used as the feature extractor.
- **Custom Layer for Stacking**: A custom TensorFlow layer (`StackLayer`) is defined to stack the feature maps from the VGG16 model.
- **Deepfake Detection Model**: The deepfake detection model is built by utilizing the VGG16 model as the feature extractor, followed by a flattening layer, a dense layer, and a final dense layer with a sigmoid activation for binary classification.
- **Detection Function**: The `detect_deepfake` function takes an image path, loads the image, preprocesses it, and uses the deepfake detection model to predict whether the image is real or fake.
- **Evaluation**: The script iterates over a dataset of real and fake images and counts the number of correctly detected real and fake images.

## K-means Clustering Approach

The k-means clustering-based approach for deepfake detection is implemented in the `kmean.py` file. This method is inspired by the following research papers:

1. **"DeepfakeDetector: A Clustering-based Approach for Deepfake Detection" by Md. Jabed Nesar, Shengrui Zhang, and Md. Mehedi Hassan Bhuiyan (2022).**
   - This paper proposes a clustering-based approach using k-means clustering for detecting deepfake videos, leveraging pre-trained models for feature extraction.

2. **"Clustering-based Deepfake Detection" by Jingwei Ran, Yu Liu, and Yi Huang (2021).**
   - This work introduces a clustering-based method for deepfake detection using k-means clustering on features extracted from pre-trained models.

3. **"Deepfake Detection Using K-Means Clustering and Ensemble Learning" by Shahriar Sazzad, Yaqoub Nazir, and Md. Jabed Nesar (2021).**
   - This paper proposes a two-stage approach: k-means clustering followed by an ensemble learning classifier for deepfake detection.

### Implementation Details

The `kmean.py` file contains the following key components:

- **Pre-trained Models**: Multiple pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3) are loaded and used for feature extraction.
- **Feature Extraction**: Features are extracted from real and fake images using the pre-trained models, and the features from different models are concatenated to create a combined feature representation.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the combined features, potentially enhancing the clustering performance.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Two clustering algorithms are employed: k-means and DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise).
- **Silhouette Coefficient**: The Silhouette Coefficient is calculated for both k-means and DBSCAN clustering results to evaluate the quality of the clustering.
- **Visualization**: The clustering results are visualized using matplotlib, allowing for a qualitative assessment of the separation between real and fake image clusters.

## Usage

To run the deep learning model for deepfake detection, execute the `deepfake_detector.py` script:

```
python deepfake_detector.py
```

To run the k-means clustering-based approach, execute the `kmean.py` script:

```
python kmean.py
```

Note that both scripts assume the presence of a `Dataset` directory containing subdirectories `Test/Real` and `Test/Fake` with the corresponding real and fake images.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```
